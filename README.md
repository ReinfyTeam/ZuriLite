# Zuri Lite Anticheat  ✔
- 😁 Compared to [Zuri](https://github.com/ReinfyTeam/Zuri) it is easy to configure, easy to manage, and lightweight and customized for **Practice Servers**.
- 😎 It has limited checks, optimized for combat-relative servers.
- 👌 This is **best choice** for competitive practice servers in **Minecraft: Bedrock Edition**!

# Why i created this? 🤔
- 🛠 Actually, this plugin is intentionally for my **practice server**. 
- ⚙ It is optimized and organized specially for my Practice Server compared to original Zuri. 
- 📛 There are only limited for checks to reduce false-positive for the players.
- 💥 So, basically this is the lite anticheat for my server.
